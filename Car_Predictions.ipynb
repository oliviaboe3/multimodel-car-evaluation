    "\n",
    "\t\tSelecting a metric when the data is imbalanced is difficult. Accuracy would not be an acceptable measurement for imbalanced data, it could predict every sample as the dominant class and would return a high accuracy score. For this dataset, the main metric of focus will be MCC which will give a more balanced view of how the model performs for all classes. MCC will help us to capture both types of errors for more reliability than accuracy as it will consider the entire confusion matrix. Using MCC with a second opinion from F1 will be beneficial for both binary and multiclass classification. \n",
    "        \n",
    "\t\tThe pros of changing the input variables to numerical are that some models are more compatible with models such as logistic regression, decision trees, and SVM. Additionally, the distance model (KNN) will be able to consider the ordinal information of which class is further from each other. Overall changing the numerical input variables is helpful for capturing relationships for ordinal data. The con of numerical encoding is that it may lose meaning in categorical data or have information loss. \n",
    "        \n",
    "\t\tThe pro to binary transformation is that it is simple and efficient when you have categorical data. It will work well with decision trees or other tree-based models. The major downside is that we may lose information in ordinal data. Additionally, multiclass variables tend to complicate the process, there can be misinterpretation along the way.\n",
    "        \n",
    "\t\tWith the multiclass target variable, there are different ways to run analysis. There is the one versus one method or one versus many. One versus one method would be more beneficial when the number of classes are small as it would turn out to be N*(N-2)/2. One versus many would be better for many classes in addition to unbalanced data sets. Since this dataset only has 4, one versus one would be more beneficial.\n",
    "\t\t\n",
    "Overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "    To build the best model, MCC is chosen as the priority metric while F1, Recall, and Precision are all considered second. Because of the imbalanced data, accuracy will not be an important metric. To start, the data will be split into training and testing sets. From there, the training data will be converted into two data sets: one for categorical classification (binary) and one for ordinal classification (numerical). I will run Decision Tree, KNN, SVM, logistic regression, and naïve bayes on both the binary and numerical data sets with nested CV. \n",
    "\n",
    "    As the data is moderately imbalanced, some models will need additional hyperparameters and pre-processing to help balance the dataset. KNN and logistic regression will use smote to help balance the dataset. SVM will use class weight to help with the imbalanced data. Additionally, all models were trained as one versus the rest, this is to help combat the imbalanced data. \n",
    "\n",
    "    Finally, I will select the best model from nested cross validation based off MCC scores. The best model will go through hyperparameter tuning and be tested on the remaining holdout data. \n"

    "Since MCC is a metric that considers all types of errors, it will be prioritized when selecting a model. However, SVM outperformed every model in both binary and ordinal datasets. From the results, almost all models performed better using binary data over numerical data. There is one exception and that is KNN, it performed better on the ordinal dataset as KNN is a distance-based model. Moving forward, SVM will be tuned to find its best hyperparameters and will be fitted to the entire training dataset for both categorical and numerical datasets. We will then test both datasets to see which dataset performs better. "

    "Both the binary and ordinal SVM models selected a regularization strength of C = 10, indicating a lower tolerance for misclassification and a preference for a more complex decision boundary. This likely reflects the use of Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) as the tuning metric, which strongly penalizes misclassified examples in imbalanced settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both models also selected the RBF kernel with gamma set to 'scale', which adapts based on the input feature variance. Because the ordinal dataset uses label encoding (with larger feature magnitudes) compared to the one-hot encoded binary dataset, the effective gamma value would be smaller for the ordinal model, not larger.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the binary model outperformed the ordinal model across all metrics, achieving an MCC score of 0.9869 versus 0.9683. This is expected, as binary classification typically yields better performance than multi-class classification—particularly when classes are well-separated. The binary model also achieved near-perfect recall, precision, and F1 score, which aligns with a clean confusion matrix dominated by correct predictions."
